# Neural Network to Predict Bike Sharing Rides

## Introduction
This is the first project in a series of Deep Learning foundation's projects at Udacity.

## Objective
In this project, the requirement is to build a simple neural network with prepared data set and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership. Implementation includes forward pass and backpropagation algorithm, and a setup for the hyperparameters: the learning rate, the number of hidden units, and the number of training passes.
